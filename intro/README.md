Introduction to Functional Programming in Scala
============

In this tutorial we will start with a trivial program, written in imperative 
style, and through a series of refactorings transform it into a functional 
program while learning the core FP concepts like referential transparency, 
expression-based programming, recursion, immutability and higher-order 
functions.

Getting Started
-------

Open file `src/main/scala/Main.scala` in your editor of choice. To run the 
program start `sbt` from the terminal and type `run` in SBT prompt.
